# Making Chilean Government data Closer to Chileans

Data is out there, but it is still far from the people. 
It is scattered in multiple HTML pages.

Here we explore transforming all the HTML pages into actual data tables, and grasp the impact could it have.

## First phase: 
1. Web scraping salaries data from [Gobierno Transparente](http://www.gobiernotransparentechile.gob.cl/)
2. Clean, standardize, transform the data into usable tables
3. Explore and publish relevant insights

## Second phase:
1. Scrape the whole transparency site
2. Create a web service that allows sharing the clean, tabulated data for all to use
