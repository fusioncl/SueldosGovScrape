# Narrowing the gap between Chilean Government Data and Chileans

Data is out there, but scattered in multiple HTML pages. Impossible to analyze. What is the real value?

Here we explore transforming all the HTML pages into actual data tables 
and grasp the exponential impact it could have.

## First phase: 
1. Web scraping salaries data from [Gobierno Transparente](http://www.gobiernotransparentechile.gob.cl/)
2. Clean, standardize, transform the data into usable tables
3. Explore and publish relevant insights

## Second phase:
1. Create a data pipeline based on scraping the whole transparency site, with frequent refreshes
2. Create a web service that allows sharing the clean, tabulated data for public use
